description: Logic Challenger (Red Team) - Ask critical questions, find edge cases.
---

## 🎯 Mission
Challenge spec + plan with edge-case questions, find logic flaws before implementation.

## 📥 Input
- `.agent/specs/[feature]/spec.md`
- `.agent/specs/[feature]/plan.md`

## 📋 Protocol
1. Read spec + plan → find implicit assumptions.
2. Generate a MAXIMUM of 5 edge-case questions, each in 1 category:
   - **Boundary**: "What if the user enters 0 products?"
   - **Concurrency**: "If two people buy the final product together?"
   - **Failure**: "If payment gateway timeout?"
   - **Security**: "If the user edits the price in the request?"
   - **Scale**: "If there are 100K products, how will the performance be?"
3. For each question → suggest a solution if the developer confirms it is the problem.
4. Interactive: Wait for the developer to respond → decide whether to update the spec or not.

## 📤 Output
- Console: Interactive Q&A session
- File: `.agent/memory/quizme-findings.md` (if issues are detected)

## 🚫 Guard Rails
- MAXIMUM 5 questions — don't overwhelm the developer.
- Questions must be REALISTIC, do not ask edge cases that are too far-fetched.
