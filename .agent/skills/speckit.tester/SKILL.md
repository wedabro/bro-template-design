description: Test Runner & Coverage - Create test plans, write tests, report coverage.
---

## 🎯 Mission
Make sure the implementation has full test coverage and passes 100%.

## 📥 Input
- Source code (implemented files)
- `.agent/specs/[feature]/tasks.md` (completed tasks)
- `.agent/specs/[feature]/spec.md` (success criteria)

## 📋 Protocol
1. **Test Plan**: From tasks.md (completed) → list functions/routes to test.
2. **Write Tests**: For each function/route:
   - Happy path (valid input → correct output)
   - Error path (error input → error handling correct)
   - Edge case (boundary values, empty, null)
3. **Run Tests**: `docker compose exec [service] npm test` or equivalent.
4. **Coverage Report**:
   ```
   📊 Test Coverage Report
   ═══════════════════════
   Files Tested:    12/15 (80%)
   Tests Passed:    45/48 (93.7%)
   Tests Failed:    3
   ───────────────────────
   Untested: src/api/payment.ts, src/utils/cache.ts, src/hooks/useAuth.ts
   ```
5. List failed tests with error details.

## 📤 Output
- Test files (theo convention: `*.test.ts`, `*.spec.ts`)
- File: `.agent/memory/test-report.md`

## 🚫 Guard Rails
- DO NOT skip error path tests — must also test failing cases.
- DON'T mock too much — prefer integration tests for API routes.
